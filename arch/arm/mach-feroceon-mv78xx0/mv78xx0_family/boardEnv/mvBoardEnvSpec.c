* DESCRIPTION:
*		This function returns the value of Gpp Pin that is connected

*		IDSEL 8 (device 8) interrupt A is connected to GPIO pin 4 the function 
*		will return the value 4.
*		This function supports multiple PCI interfaces.
*
* INPUT:
*		pciIf  - PCI interface number. 
*		devNum - device number (IDSEL).
*		intPin - Interrupt pin (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4).
*
* OUTPUT:
*		None.
*
* RETURN:
*       GPIO pin number. The function return -1 for bad parameters.
