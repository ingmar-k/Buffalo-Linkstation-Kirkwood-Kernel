OpenSSL
===========
 In order to explore the CESA unit through the OpenSSL, you have to use the 
 OpenSSL OCF cryptodev engine.By default the cryptodev engine will use the CESA 
 accelerator.

 o Create a crypto device: mknod /dev/crypto c 10 70
 o download openssl-0.9.8l (http://www.openssl.org/), then untar+unzip it.
 o apply the patches (in the following order):
 	- openssl_ocf.patch: a patch from OCF for the OpenSSL cryptodev.
 o copy from kernel crypto/ocf/cryptodev.h to FS /usr/include/crypto .
 o Run: `./config --with-cryptodev shared `
 o and compile ...('make' and 'make install')
 o When the compilation is finished, copy the following files(from openssl root directory) to /lib:
	- libcrypto.so
	- libcrypto.so.0.9.8
	- libssl.so
	- libssl.so.0.9.8

 you can run a speed test to make sure everything is working:
	openssl speed -evp des3 -elapsed 
 Modify /dev/crypto to /dev/crypto_tmp so that the speed test will use
 now software encryption.
 Run again:
        openssl speed -evp des3 -elapsed
 Compare results.
